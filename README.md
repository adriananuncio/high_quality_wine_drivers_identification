# # # Wine Classification Project

### Project Overview
_____________________________________________________________________________________
This project is designed to identify key drivers in scoring wine quality and predict wine score accuracy for red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.

**Objectives**

- Document code, process (data acquistion, preparation, exploratory data analysis and statistical testing, modeling, and model evaluation), findings, and key takeaways in a Jupyter notebook final report.

- Create modules (wrangle.py) that make your process repeateable and your report (notebook) easier to read and follow.

- Ask exploratory questions of your data that will help you understand more about the attributes and drivers of home value. Answer questions through charts and statistical tests.

- Construct a classification model to predict wine scores with greater accuracy than the baseline.



**Deliverables**

- a complete readme.md which walks through the details of the project
- a final report (.ipynb) which concisely displays the finished version of the project
- wrangle.py file to hold all data acquisition, preparation, testing, and modeling functions
- exploratory workbook showing the unpolished groundwork and insights that lead to the final notebook

## 1. Acquire & Prepare

#### Acquire Actions
- Data acquired as csvs from data.world's Food database as two dataframes for red and white wines, respectively
-  6497 rows x 12 columns total
- Metrics called: fixed_acidity, volatile_acidity, citric_acid, 
  residual_sugar, chloride, free_sulfur_dioxide, total_sulfur_dioxide,
  density, ph, sulphates, alcohol, quality
#### Prepare Actions:
- Concat dataframes for red and white wine metrics
- 
-
-
- Remove outliers from dataset
- Split data into train/val/test datasets

#### Functions called from wrangle.py:
1. import_dataframes(a,b)


## 2. Exploration/ Correlation Analysis
